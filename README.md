### Note sharing
There are 2 main ways of presenting notes on this website.

1. **Web** - notes are directly shown as files, usually PDF, through a custom-made file manager.
2. **Obsidian** - notes are shown online using the plugin [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) via the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
___
### Course manager
The course manager is the main page of the website. 
- The HTML is at [`/home.html`](/home.html).
- The JavaScript [`coursemanager.js`](/web/lib/coursemanager.js) fetches the course list at `/courses.json` and shows them on the page.
    - The `/courses.json` syntax is shown at [`/courses.example.json`](/courses.example.json).
- A dropdown `#sorter` lets the user sort the courses by Term or Subject.
- The theme toggle `#theme_toggle` is from [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) for consistency with the notes. 
___
### File manager
The file manager shows the UI for the **web** type of notes. 
- The HTML is at [`/web/fm.html`](/web/fm.html).
- The JavaScript [`filemanager.js`](/web/lib/filemanager.js) takes the `search` URL `GET` parameter then fetches to find a match at `/web/lib/fm.json`.
    - The `/web/lib/fm.json` syntax is shown at [`/web/lib/fm.example.json`](/web/lib/fm.example.json).
- Once a match is found, it fetches the `dirLocation` specified in the JSON and shows the top layer files.
- The `dirLocation` JSON file is automatically generated using the [`fmGen.py`](/web/lib/fmGen.py) file.
    - The `dirLocation` syntax is shown at [`/web/lib/dirLocation.example.json`](/web/lib/dirLocation.example.json).
- If the user clicks on a file, they are redirected to the `source` URL
- If the user clicks on a folder, the files under `content` are shown with a "Return" button at the top.
___
### Technologies
- The ***web*** section is run on frontend HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The ***obsidian*** section is frontend code generated by the plugin [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export) via the note-taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Icons are from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/), most of which requires attribution. See credits at [`/web/lib/acknowledgements.html`](https://munotes.tinagrit.com/web/lib/acknowledgements.html) in production.
