The notes provided on this website are taken from my classes at Simon Fraser University and Richmond Secondary School. None of those materials could have been here without the amazing instructions from the professors and teachers listed below and in the "Course Info" section of each course.

Most of the newer notes are taken using the free software [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). These are exported to the web with the help of [Webpage HTML Export](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export).
